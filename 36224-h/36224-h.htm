<h2>NOTES ON THE KIOWA SUN DANCE.</h2>

<p>The following notes were obtained from Andres Martinez (Andele, a Mexican
captive of the Kiowa whose history<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
is well known) in August, 1919. Attention was directed in the first instance to
the organization of the dance, but a brief description of the whole ceremony was
also obtained, chiefly by way of comments on Scott's account.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The last Kiowa sun dance was held in 1887.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Kiowa sun dance is the prerogative of the individual who owns the sacred
image, the <i>tai'me</i>. He deputes the ancillary offices where he sees fit,
although there is a well-defined tendency for them to be hereditary. The
predominant idea of this image is that of a war medicine. Thus the dance is
fundamentally like that of the Crow, but it differs from it in two important
respects. First, the Kiowa rites cluster about only one particular medicine,
whereas among the Crow, any one of a number of medicine dolls may be used in the
ceremony. The question arises whether the dozen minor Kiowa images, which are
sometimes brought into the dance, were more recently acquired or constructed in
order to reproduce the functions of the <i>tai'me</i>, or whether one medicine
doll has completely overshadowed all the others, as seemed about to happen among
the Crow. The evidence favors the first view, since no rites, other than those
attendant on any personal medicine, are described, or even intimated, for the
minor images. The second difference is, that while the Crow shaman invokes his
medicine for any one who appeals to him for aid, acting only in a directive
capacity, the Kiowa <i>tai'me</i>
owner is himself the principal suppliant. Were it not for the hereditary bias in
the distribution of ceremonial functions, the Kiowa sun dance would be the
prerogative of one man as completely as that of the Crow is, when the latter is
once under way. The hereditary principle does not appear in the military
societies except in the ownership of the medicine lance or arrow (<i>zë'bo</i>).<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The Kiowa sun dance (<i>k&rsquo;o<sup>θ</sup>du<sup>n</sup></i> specifically the
name for the lodge) was an annual tribal affair, in which the associated Kiowa
Apache freely joined.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It was danced in an effort to obtain material benefits from, or through, the
medicine doll in the possession of the medicineman, who is at the same time
director and principal performer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg
438]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a small image, less than 2 feet in length,
	representing a human figure dressed in a robe of white feathers, with a
	headdress consisting of a single upright feather and pendants of ermine
	skin, with numerous strands of blue beads around its neck, and painted upon
	the face, breast, and back with designs symbolic of the sun and moon.
	[Martinez says the face is entirely obscured by hanging beads.] The image
	itself is of dark-green stone, in form rudely resembling a human head and
	bust, probably shaped by art like the stone fetishes of the Pueblo tribes.
	It is preserved in a rawhide box in charge of the hereditary keeper, and is
	never under any circumstances exposed to view except at the annual sun
	dance, when it is fastened to a short upright stick planted within the
	medicine lodge, near the western side.... The ancient <i>tai'me</i>
	image was of buckskin, with a stalk of Indian tobacco for a headdress. This
	buckskin image was left in the medicine lodge, with all the other adornments
	and sacrificial offerings, at the close of each ceremony. The present <i>
	tai'me</i> is one of three, two of which came originally from the Crows,
	through an Arapaho who married into the Kiowa tribe, while the third came by
	capture from the Blackfeet.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>

<p>The bundle containing the image is usually hung outside of its keeper's tipi.
It is not customary to expose the image except at the sun dance, but tobacco is
placed with it from time to time. Its function outside of the dance is identical
with its use there: those who need its aid make vows to it, which they fulfil by
sacrificing horses, etc., and making sweatlodges. The image is the property of
one man, or more properly of his family, since it may be inherited by his blood
relatives. If the transfer is made before the father's death, payment and a
sweatlodge must be given by the son.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
After Long Foot died about 1870, as he had no son, it passed into the possession
of three of his nephews in succession, and reverted in 1894 to his daughter who
still has it.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
While she may handle the image, she would not be permitted to enter the dance
with it.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
There the functions which would normally devolve on her would be performed in
their entirety by a captive. This captive has been trained to the position in
order to take the place of the image keeper should he be sick. A captive is
chosen for the substitute so that a calamity incurred by a mischance in the
proceedings may fall on him alone and not on the Kiowa. The erstwhile
substitute, a Mexican, is still living. The image keeper, like his four
associates, must not look in a mirror, nor touch a skunk or jackrabbit. One who
touches these animals cannot enter the tipi where the doll is housed until four
days have elapsed. No dog is allowed in this tipi, nor is one permitted to jump
over the keeper or his four associates, the <i>g.uo&#322;g.u&#551;t`</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg
439]</a></span></p>

<p>There are ten or twelve minor images (<i>ta<sup>i</sup>lyúk&#551;</i>) which
strongly resemble the <i>tai'me</i> in function, as they are essentially war
medicines. Most of them were in the keeping of men other than the sacred doll
owner, but two were kept by him for a time.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
They have little or no part in the sun dance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>Gadômbítsoñhi</i>,
	"Old-woman-under-the-ground," belonged to the Kiñep band of the Kiowa. It
	was a small image, less than a foot high, representing a woman with flowing
	hair. It was exposed in front of the <i>tai'me</i> at the great sun-dance
	ceremony, and by some unexplained jugglery the priest in charge of it caused
	it to rise out of the ground, dance in the sight of the people, and then
	again sink into the earth.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></div>

<p>The sun dance was normally an annual ceremony, but sometimes a year passed
without one. The dance was theoretically dependent on someone going to the
keeper and saying, "I dreamed of it (<i>i.e.</i>, the sun dance)," or on the
keeper himself dreaming of it. On two occasions a second dance was held in the
dance lodge after the keeper had removed the sacred doll at the close of the
first dance, because a second man had also dreamed of it.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
After the dream is announced the keeper hangs the image on his back and rides
out to all the camps, announcing, as he circles them, that he will conduct the
ceremony the following spring (May or June). This announcement was sometimes
made immediately after the close of the preceding dance, but usually it came
just before they intended to hold the dance.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
The keeper fasts while he is making the announcement, even if it takes three
days, as may happen when the camps were scattered. When they know the dance is
to be held, others vow to dance for a specified number of days, and all gather
near the dance ground. No one may absent himself: they are all afraid of his
medicine. When the tribe is assembled, the keeper circles the camp, again
bearing the sacred doll on his back.</p>

<p>Two young men are selected by the keeper from one of the military societies<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
to scout for a tree to serve as center pole for the dance lodge. While
searching, they must refrain from drinking. About this time all those intending
to dance are building sweatlodges to purify themselves: the keeper must enter
each of these to direct the proceedings; this entails considerable work on him.
Should he be sick at this time, the doll is carried into the sweatlodge by the
captive in his stead. It is incumbent on the <i>tai'me</i> shield owners to
accompany this captive and help him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg
440]</a></span>
perform the necessary ceremonies. When the tree for the center pole has been
selected, the whole camp moves after the keeper and his family to the dance
ground. A dozen or more old men follow immediately after him. The main body is
guarded front, rear, and both flanks by the military societies, as is customary
when a camp moves.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The procession halts four times on its journey while the keeper smokes and
prays. Next, the soldier societies charge on the dance ground, or rather on a
pole erected there before the camp circle is established,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
according to Methvin (p. 64), but on the newly established camp itself according
to Scott's informants (p. 357).</p>

<p>The next morning the man who has that privilege sets out with his wife to get
the hide of a young buffalo bull. When such a person dies, the keeper appoints
one of his kin to take his place.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
The couple must fast while on this hunt. If the buffalo is killed with a single
arrow, it is a favorable omen, if many are needed, the opposite is indicated.
The buffalo must be killed so that he falls on his belly with his head toward
the east. A broad strip of back skin, with the tail and head skin attached is
carried to the keeper's tipi, where feathers are tied to its head.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The next morning they set out to fetch the center pole. Scott describes a
parade around the camp circle by the military societies which then proceed to
charge the tree selected for the center pole, which is defended in sham combat
by one of the men's societies<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
(<i>akiaik`to</i>, war with the trees). After the chiefs have recited their
coups, and prayers have been said by the sacred doll keeper and his wife, who
have brought the doll there, the tree is chopped down by a captive Mexican
woman. A captive is always selected for this difficult task, so that any harm
due to an error on her part may not fall on a tribesman. This function is always
performed by a Mexican woman: when she dies, the keeper appoints her successor.
As the tree falls, they shout and shoot in the air. The pole is carried to the
dance ground by a society designated by the keeper,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
where a hole to receive it has been dug by a men's military society.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
The pole is set upright by a single medicineman who owns this privilege. The
buffalo hide is then fastened across the forks with its head to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg
441]</a></span>
east and offerings of cloth, etc., brought by various individuals are tied to
it. In 1873 Battey observed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The central post is ornamented near the ground with
	the robes of buffalo calves, their heads up, as if in the act of climbing
	it; each of the branches above the fork is ornamented in a similar manner,
	with the addition of shawls, calico, scarfs, &amp;c., and covered at the top
	with black muslin. Attached to the fork is a bundle of cottonwood and willow
	limbs, firmly bound together, and covered with a buffalo robe, with head and
	horns, so as to form a rude image of a buffalo, to which were hung strips of
	new calico, muslin, strouding, both blue and scarlet, feathers, shawls, &amp;c.,
	of various lengths and qualities. The longer and more showy articles were
	placed near the ends. This image was so placed as to face the east.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;">
<span class="caption">Fig. 1. Groundplan of Dance Lodge.</span>
<img src="images/grey441.png" alt="Fig. 1. Groundplan of Dance Lodge." height="335" width="369" />
</div>

<p>The center pole is not painted.</p>

<p>After the center pole is in place, everyone, but especially the military
societies, assists in building the enclosing structure. The lodge is like those
of the Arapaho and Cheyenne: it is circular, the rafters rest on the center
pole, and the covering of boughs extends a third of the way to the center of the
roof. An entrance is left on the east side. A flat stone is placed here so that
every dancer passing through must set his foot on it. Wet sand is spread over
the ground in the dance lodge<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and heaped around the base of the center pole. Two little round holes, walled in
with mud, are dug near the rear of the lodge to hold incense smudges. A screen
of cottonwood and cedar branches is constructed just north of these.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg
442]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This business continued through the day, except for an
	hour or two in the middle of the afternoon, when the old women<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>&mdash;the
	grandmothers of the tribe&mdash;had a dance. The music consisted of singing and
	drumming, done by several old women, who were squatted on the ground in a
	circle. The dancers&mdash;old, gray-headed women, from sixty to eighty years of
	age&mdash;performed in a circle around them for some time, finally striking off
	upon a waddling run, one behind another; they formed a circle, came back
	and, doubling so as to bring two together, threw their arms around each
	other's necks, and trudged around for some time longer; then sat down, while
	a youngish man circulated the pipe, from which each in turn took two or
	three whiffs, and this ceremony ended.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>[When the dance lodge was completed] the soldiers of the tribe then had a
frolic in and about it, running and jumping, striking and kicking, throwing one
another down, stripping and tearing the clothes off each other.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>...
Before this frolic was over, a party of ten or twelve warriors appeared, moving
a kind of shield to and fro before their bodies, making, in some manner (as I
was not near enough to see how it was done), a grating sound, not unlike the
filing of a mill-saw.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In the afternoon, a party of a dozen or more warriors and braves proceeded to
the medicine house, followed by a large proportion of the people of the
encampment. They were highly painted, and wore shirts only, with head-dresses of
feathers which extended down the backs to the ground, and were kept in their
proper places by means of an ornamented strap clasping the waist. Some of them
had long horns attached to their head-dresses. They were armed with lances and
revolvers, and carrying a couple of long poles mounted from end to end with
feathers, the one white and the other black. They also bore shields highly
ornamented with paint, feathers, and hair.</p>

<p>They took their station upon the side opposite the entrance, the musicians
standing behind them.</p>

<p>Many old women occupied a position to the right and near the entrance, who
set up a tremulous shrieking; the drums began to beat, and the dance began, the
party above described only participating in it.</p>

<p>They at first slowly advanced towards the central post, followed by the
musicians several of whom carried a side of raw hide (dried), which was beaten
upon with sticks, making about as much music as to beat upon the sole of an old
shoe, while the drums, the voices of the women, and the rattling of pebbles in
instruments of raw hide filled out the choir.</p>

<p>After slowly advancing nearly to the central post, they retired backward,
again advanced, a little farther than before; this was repeated several times,
each time advancing a little farther, until they crowded upon the spectators,
drew their revolvers, and discharged them into the air.</p>

<p>Soon after, the women rushed forward with a shrieking yell, threw their
blankets violently upon the ground, at the feet of the retiring dancers,
snatched them up with the same tremulous shriek that had been before produced,
and retired; which closed this part of the entertainment. The ornamented shields
used on this occasion were afterwards hung up with the medicine.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>These may be the shields which are associated with the <i>tai'me</i>. Later,
after the sacred doll has been brought into the lodge, they are either hung with
it on the cedar screen as Battey observed,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
or on stakes set up outside the dance lodge to the west, i.e., behind the image,
where Martinez saw them. No offerings are made to them there. It is incumbent on
a <i>tai'me</i> shield owner to dance with the associates (<i>g.uo&#322;g.u&#551;t`</i>)
in every sun dance so long as he continues to own the shield. He is not
considered one of the associates however. Shield owners always help the image
keeper when he asks their aid. They must also assist his captive substitute when
officiating in a sweatlodge. A shield owner cannot sell his shield, but he may
give it to his son in anticipation of his death, receiving presents in return.
Otherwise, on the death of its owner the shield is placed on his grave. Should a
son or nephew dream of it, he has the right to make a duplicate with the help of
the doll owner in order to keep it in the family. However, if any other man
dreams of it and wants to make the duplicate, he must pay the owner.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
The shield is usually hung outside of its owner's tipi. The shield owners "must
not eat buffalo hearts, or touch a bearskin, or have anything to do with a
bear." Like the associates, "they must not smoke with their moccasins on,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
or kill, or eat any kind of rabbit, or kill or touch a skunk."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
These shields are used only in war as their owner's personal medicine: no
offerings are ever made to them.</p>

<p>Late in the day, a number of men who have vowed to take part in the
subsequent dance, together with one woman who has the privilege,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
are garbed in buffalo robes to represent the living animals. They gather to the
east of the lodge where they simulate the actions of a herd of buffalo. A man,
called a scout, starts from the entrance of the lodge with a firebrand and
circles about the herd until he meets a second man, mounted and carrying a
shield and a straight pipe, who thereupon drives the buffalo toward the dance
lodge, which they circle several times before negotiating the entrance. Once
inside they lie down; the man with the pipe dismounts and
enters. Picking up the hairs on the back of first one animal and another, he
says, "This is the fattest animal. He is our protector in war." Then he recites
a coup. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
designated (or makes ?) a brave man of that buffalo.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Both the man with the firebrand and he with the pipe ought to be medicinemen.
The present incumbent of the first office also has the privilege of erecting the
center pole. When these men die, the sacred doll keeper selects successors from
their families.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>That evening after sunset the dance proper begins, to last four nights and
days, ending in the evening. The doll keeper proceeds to his own tipi, where,
with the assistance of seven other medicinemen (<i>tai'me</i> shield keepers and
some others not otherwise connected with the ceremony), he unwraps the <i>tai'me</i>.
Carrying it on his back, he walks to the dance lodge, and, completely circles it
four times, feigning to enter each time he passes the entrance. After entering,
he goes around by the south side to the northwest quadrant, where he plants the
image hanging on a staff. Formerly two or more of the minor images, <i>ta<sup>i</sup>lyúk&#551;</i>,
were placed with the <i>tai'me</i>. After the image is in place the dancers
enter to perform for the night.</p>

<p>The keeper dances throughout the whole four-day period. He is painted yellow,
with a design representing the sun, and sometimes another for the moon, drawn on
his chest and back. "His face was painted, like that of the Taimay itself, with
red and black zigzag lines downward from the eyes." He wears a yellow buckskin
kilt, a jackrabbit skin cap with down attached, and sage wristlets. He is
barefoot. He carries a bunch of cedar in his hand, and an eagle bone whistle
from which an eagle feather is pendent. Battey observed that he was painted
white at the "buffalo-herding" rite, and not painted at all in the dance proper.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Beside the <i>tai'me</i> keeper there are three classes of persons who dance;
the associates (<i>g.uo&#322;g.u&#551;t`</i>), the <i>tai'me</i> shield keepers, and the
common dancers. The four associates (Scott's "keeper's assistants") must dance
throughout the whole four day period. They appear in four successive dances
(normally four years), after which they choose successors from among those young
men, eighteen to thirty years old, who have made the best records in war. These
young men, with the assistance of their relatives,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
pay horses and buffalo robes for the privilege, receiving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg
445]</a></span>
regalia in return.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
One who is chosen cannot refuse: if he does, he may expect a calamity. The
associate may belong to any of the military societies. His office does not
impose obligations of foolhardiness in war (such as the no-flight idea), but he
is obliged to act the part of an intrepid warrior, because he enjoys security in
battle.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
The associate must not look in a mirror lest he become blind,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
nor can he touch a skunk or jackrabbit, nor remain near a fire where someone is
cooking. Dogs must not be permitted to jump over an associate. He must remove
his moccasins before he smokes, but others may keep theirs on when smoking in
his presence. The associate dances in order to live long and to be a great
warrior. His body is painted white or yellow: a round spot representing the sun
is painted on the middle of his chest, with a crescent moon (the concavity
upward) on both sides of the sun, and the same decoration is repeated on his
back. The skin is cut away as a sacrifice and to make these designs permanent
after his first dance. A scalp from a <i>tai'me</i>
shield hangs on his breast with two eagle feathers; another on his back. His
face is "ornamented with a green stripe across the forehead, and around down the
sides of the cheeks, to the corners of the mouth, and meeting on the chin."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
He wears a yellow buckskin kilt, with his breechclout hung outside, like the
Arapaho and Cheyenne sun dancers. Bunches of sage are stuck into his belt,
others tied around his wrists and ankles, and carried in each hand. On his head
is either a cap of jackrabbitskin in which is stuck an eagle feather or a sage
wreath with down attached. He carries a bone whistle. Like the sacred doll
keeper and all other dancers, he is barefoot.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Battey saw three associates purify themselves in the incense from the censors,
and then dance on piles of sage.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The <i>tai'me</i> shield owners, who dance with the associates are sometimes
painted yellow or green with pictures of the sun and moon on their bodies, but
otherwise they wear the regalia of the common dancers.</p>

<p>The rank and file of the dancers are men, never women. Anyone may vow to
dance a certain number of days, with the object of becoming a better warrior and
living long.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They believe that it warded off sickness, caused
	happiness, prosperity, many children, success in war, and plenty of buffalo
	for all the people. It was frequently vowed by persons in danger from
	sickness or the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">
[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes a medicineman danced to intercede for a sick man. A sick man who
had vowed to attend the dance in order to be cured would be carried into the
dance lodge, but he would not dance. These dancers make offerings to the <i>
tai'me</i>. They do not pay the doll keeper in order to enter the dance, and
they have no rights in any subsequent performance by reason of having once
participated. Like all other dancers they must fast and go without water during
the period that they dance; they can however, smoke, provided the proper rites
are observed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... The pipe was filled, brought forward, and laid
	upon the ground; the person, carefully turning the stem towards the fire,
	and bedding it in the sand, so that the bowl should remain in an upright
	position, arose and stood with his back towards it, or facing the medicine.
	It was then approached by one of the musicians, who, in a squatting
	position, raised his hand reverently towards the sun, the medicine, the top
	of the central post, or buffalo; then, passing his hands slowly over the
	pipe, took it up with his left hand, and taking a pinch from the bowl with
	the thumb and fore finger of the right, held it to the sun, the medicine,
	the top of the central post, then the bottom, and finally covered it up in
	the ground. He then proceeded to light the pipe, blowing a whiff of smoke
	towards the several objects of adoration, and placed it carefully where he
	found it, in reversed order, that is, with the stem from the fire. The
	person who brought it had stood waiting all this time for it. He now took it
	up and retired to the dancers, who, wrapped in buffalo robes, were waiting,
	in a squatting position, to receive it. The sand where the pipe had lain was
	carefully smoothed by the hand, and all marks of it wholly obliterated.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p></div>

<p>These dancers are painted white; they wear white buckskin kilts, with the
breechclout outside, carry bone whistles, and are barefoot. They have no
headdress, wrist or ankle ornaments. They paint themselves.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
There is only one style of paint used by either the principal or the common
dancers throughout the sun dance.</p>

<p>The dancers form a line on the east side of the lodge facing the image. Their
step is that characteristic of the sun dance of other tribes: they stand in
place, alternately bending their knees and rising on their toes. They dance
intermittently throughout four days and nights; the common dancers leave as the
periods for which they have vowed to dance have elapsed or when they can no
longer stand the combined strain of fasting, thirsting, and dancing. Martinez
left after three days and nights. The "four days and nights" which are specified
are in reality only three nights and days; evidently the first day of
preliminary dancing is included to fill out the quota to the magic "four." In
Scott's account, the dancers perform on the first day from evening to the middle
of the night, and on the succeeding days from sunrise to the chorus's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg
447]</a></span>
breakfast, nine o'clock to dinner, four in the afternoon to sundown, and from
evening to midnight, ending in the evening of the fourth day. The dance Battey
describes evidently began in the evening of the 18th and continued
intermittently to late afternoon of the 21st. Apparently the dancers do not
leave the lodge during this entire period.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>19th</i> [June, 1873.]&mdash;Music and dancing continued
	in the medicine house through the night. At an early hour this morning I
	went thither with Couguet, and witnessed one dance throughout. The ground
	inside the enclosure had been carefully cleared of grass, sticks, and roots,
	and covered, several inches deep, with a clean, white sand. A screen had
	been constructed on the side opposite the entrance, by sticking small
	cottonwoods and cedars deep into the ground, so as to preserve them fresh as
	long as possible. A space was left, two or three feet wide, between it and
	the enclosing wall, in which the dancers prepared themselves for the dance,
	and in front of which was the medicine. This consisted of an image, lying on
	the ground, but so concealed from view, in the screen, as to render its form
	indistinguishable; above it was a large fan, made of eagle quills, [an
	error, these are crow feathers], with the quill part lengthened out nearly a
	foot, by inserting a stick into it, and securing it there. These were held
	in a spread form by means of a willow rod, or wire, bent in a circular form;
	above this was a mass of feathers, concealing an image, on each side of
	which were several shields, highly decorated with feathers and paint.
	Various other paraphernalia of heathen worship were suspended in the screen,
	among these shields or over them, impossible for me to describe so as to be
	comprehended. A mound had also been thrown up around the central post of the
	building, two feet high, and perhaps five feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The musicians, who, if I mistake not, are the war chiefs, were squatted on
the ground, in true heathen style, to the left, and near the entrance, having
Indian drums and rattles. The music was sounding when we entered.</p>

<p>Presently the dancers came from behind the screen; their faces, arms, and the
upper part of their bodies were painted white; a soft, white buckskin skirt,
secured about the loins, descended nearly to the ankles, while the
breech-cloth,&mdash;blue on this occasion,&mdash;hanging to the ground, outside the skirt,
both in front and behind, completed the dress. They faced the medicine&mdash;shall I
say idols? for it was conducted with all the solemnity of worship,&mdash;jumping up
and down in true time with the beating of the drums, while a bone whistle in
their mouths, through which the breath escaped as they jumped about, and the
singing of the women, completed the music. The dancers continued to face the
medicine, with arms stretched upwards and towards it,&mdash;their eyes as it were
riveted to it. They were apparently oblivious to all surroundings, except the
music and what was before them.</p>

<p>After some time, a middle-aged man, painted as the others, but wearing a
buffalo robe, issued from behind the screen, facing the entrance, but having his
eyes fixed upon the sun, upon which he stood gazing, without winking or moving a
muscle, for some time, then began slowly to incline his head from side to side,
as if to avoid some obstruction in his view of it, swaying his body slightly,
then, stepping slowly from side to side&mdash;forward&mdash;backward&mdash;increasing his motions,
both in rapidity and extent, until in appearance nearly frantic, his robes fell
off, leaving him&mdash;except his blue breechclout&mdash;entirely naked. In this condition
he jumped and ran about the enclosure,&mdash;head, arms, and legs all equally
participating in the violence of his gestures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg
448]</a></span>&mdash;every joint of his body apparently loosened, his eyes only
fixed. I wondered how, with every joint apparently dislocated, and every
muscular fibre relaxed, he could maintain the upright position.</p>

<p>Thus he continued to exercise without ceasing, or once removing his eyes from
the sun, until the sweat ran down in great rolling drops, washing the white
paint into streaks no more ornamental than the original painting, and he was at
length compelled to retire, from mere exhaustion, the other dancers still
continuing their exercises.</p>

<p>Presently another man [the <i>tai'me</i> keeper] entered from behind the
screen, wearing an Indian fur cap and a blue breechcloth reaching to the ground.
He was unpainted, and had a human scalp fastened to his scalplock, the soft,
flowing hair of which, spreading out upon his naked back, bore mute testimony to
the tragical death of some unfortunate white woman. This man, with a kind of
half running jump, still in step with the music, went around all the dancers,
who did not notice him, with one arm stretched out over his heads, first in one
direction, then the other, turning his course at every time, after stopping in
front of the medicine, and making some indescribable motions before it. He
sometimes parted the feathers concealing the small image, appearing to examine
it minutely, as if searching for something, and sometimes putting his lips to
it, as if in the act of kissing it. [He takes some medicine root into his mouth,
chews it and blows it on the dancers.]<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
At length, after repeated examinations, he, apparently for the first time,
discovered the fan, and took hold of it hesitatingly, and as if afraid.</p>

<p>This was loosed from its fastenings by a hand behind the screen, and he
slowly raised it up, looking intently at it, while the expression of his
countenance indicated a fearfulness of the result of handling an object whose
hidden and mysterious powers were so far beyond his comprehension. He held it up
before the medicine, waved it up and down, and from side to side, then, turning
round so as to face the dancers and spectators, waved it from side to side near
the ground, once around the dancers; then, raising it above his head, he waved
it in the same manner, performing another circle around the dancers.</p>

<p>Then, with gestures of striking, and a countenance scowling as with fierce
rage, he began to chase them around and around the ring, [i.e., around the
center pole] from left to right. Finally, getting one of them separated from the
rest, he pursued him with the most fiend-like attitude, fiercely striking at him
with his fan. The pursued one fled from him with a countenance expressive of
almost death-like terror, until, after several rounds, he stumbled and fell
heavily to the ground. Another and another were thus separated from the dancers,
pursued, and fell before the mystical power of the fan, and the act closed.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p></div>

<p>The "feather-killing" (<i>stai&#277;nki&#259;&#322;</i>, he runs after them with feathers)
occurs every day in the late forenoon.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
The associates as well as the other dancers, are fanned into unconsciousness.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
In such a condition they would try to get visions: they would rise, call for a
pipe, and announce what they had seen.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Being called to a council of the war chiefs, I went no
	more to the medicine house to-day, though the music and dancing continued
	the whole time, by day and by night, with short intervals between the
	different acts, to give opportunity for rest, arranging dress, painting, and
	such other changes as the programme of the ceremony demanded.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Saw but one dance to-day. Quite a quantity of goods, such as
blankets, strouding (blue and scarlet list-cloth), calico, shawls, scarfs, and
other Indian wares, had been carried into the medicine house previous to my
entrance. The dancers had been painted white, three of them [the <i>g.uolg.u&#551;t`</i>]
ornamented with a green stripe across the forehead, and around down the sides of
the cheeks, to the corner of the mouth, and meeting on the chin. A round green
spot was painted on the back and breast, about three inches in diameter, while
on either side of it, and somewhat elevated above it, was a crescent of the same
size and color. Two small, hollow mounds of sand and clay had been made before
the medicine, in which fire was placed, and kept just sufficiently burning, with
the partially dried cottonwood leaves, cedar twigs, and probably tobacco, to
produce a smoke. A small fire was burning near the musicians, for lighting
pipes, tightening drums, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When all was ready, the three young men, who were painted as described, were
led, each by a man clad in a buffalo robe [possibly the former <i>g.uolg.u&#551;t`</i>
who were transferring their privileges], near to the smoking mounds in front of
the medicine. An ornamented fur cap was, with some ceremony, placed upon the
head of one of them; wisps of green wild wormwood were fastened to the wrists
and ankles, which being done, he reverently raised his hands above his head,
leaning forward over one of the mounds, brought them down nearly to it; then,
straightening up, passed his hands over his face and stroked his breast. This
was repeated several times; then, after holding one foot, and the other, over
the mound, as if to warm them, two or three times, he went around the central
post, and back to the other mound, where the same ceremony was repeated. During
this whole ceremony I could perceive that his lips moved, though he uttered
nothing. I afterwards learned that it was in prayer to this effect: "May this
medicine render me brave in war, proof against the weapons of my enemies, strong
in the chase, wise in council; and, finally, may it preserve me to a good age,
and may I at last die in peace among my own people." The others, one at a time,
were similarly brought forward, and went through with the same ceremony. Three
bunches of wild wormwood were then placed on the ground in a row, crossing the
line of entrance, and between it and the central post, upon which the three
young men were placed by their attendants, who stood behind them, with their
hands upon their shoulders, the music playing all the time. Two or three men
then approached the pile of goods, selected therefrom some plaid shawls,
strouding, blankets, scarfs, and an umbrella, and hung them over the medicine;
this being done, the six men began to dance,&mdash;the three foremost ones upon the
wormwood, with their arms stretched towards the medicine, the three others with
their hands still resting upon the shoulders of the former. After some time the
latter retired; the other dancers came from behind the screen, and joined in the
dance, which continued until they were driven off by the medicine chief, as
described in yesterday's dance. All these ceremonies had a sacred significance,
which I did not understand, but have been informed that they believe any article
of wearing apparel, or of harness for their horses, hung up by the medicine
during these ceremonies, receives a charmed power to protect their wearers from
disease, or the assaults of their enemies, during the year.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
</p><p><i>21st.</i>&mdash;At one of the dances to-day, all but one retired behind the
screen, who continued to dance by himself for a long time. Various articles were
brought forward, and laid upon the ground, which he took up and hung in
proximity to the medicine. After along time, the other dancers reappeared, and
he retired; these continued their exercises, until driven off as before. The
last dance differed from the preceding in this: the last man selected and
separated from the others by the medicine chief to be driven off, though he ran
from him, did not appear terrified, and would not fall down, but retired, with
the medicine chief, behind the screen.</p>

<p>At one of the dances to-day, five human scalps were exhibited,&mdash;one attached
to each of the right wrists of two men, and one to each wrist of another,
besides the one worn attached to the scalp lock of the medicine chief. Two of
these scalps were from the heads of Indians. They had all been tanned, and
evidently belonged with the medicine fixtures.</p>

<p>The whole ceremony closed about four o'clock in the afternoon. The medicine
was packed away by the medicine chief, and the several articles which had been
hung about it&mdash;medicated, I suppose, or, in other words, sanctified by proximity
to the sacred things during the ceremonies, and consequently having power to
protect their possessors from evil&mdash;were restored to the proper owners. They then
packed them, took them upon their backs, formed into a procession, and marched,
to the music of the drums, around and out of the medicine house, whence every
one took the direction of his or her own lodge, and the ceremonies of the great
medicine were ended.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p></div>

<p>At the end of the ceremony, the image keeper chews up some medicine root and
prepares a drink, of which the dancers are permitted to imbibe a little.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>After the image has been removed, old clothing is hung on the center pole as
a sacrifice. Once Martinez saw a horse tied to the center pole as a sacrifice to
the sun. It remained there until it starved to death. Horses were also painted
and placed, together with blankets and similar valuables, on high hills as
sacrifices. Others beside the associates sacrificed their flesh to the sun at
this time, or in fact, whenever they wanted to, as Martinez has done. The Kiowa
never suspended their dancers, as in the self-torture dance of other tribes,
neither in the sun dance, nor when an individual sought a vision while fasting
alone in the mountains.</p>

<p>The night the dance closes everyone joins in a hilarious time in the dance
lodge. Next morning the camp circle breaks up, and the warriors soon go off to
war.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
They do not molest the dance lodge, though other tribes passing that way may do
so: the Kiowa do not care.

	related to that of the Kiowa, since it appeared among the Sioux before the

	Paiute, from whom the ghost dance was derived, did not hypnotize.</p></div>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
